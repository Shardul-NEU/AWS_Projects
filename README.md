## Introduction üåü

As a part of my co-op at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, I had the opportunity to work on several critical projects aimed at streamlining AWS resource management, automating tagging processes, and implementing robust CI/CD pipelines. This repository is organized into three main projects, each detailed in its own folder:

- **CostCenter Autotag**
- **Dynamic AWS Resource Tagging**
- **Quilt CI/CD**

Each project reflects a commitment to excellence and innovation in cloud computing, leveraging AWS technologies to deliver scalable and efficient solutions.

## Navigating the Repository üóÇÔ∏è

This repository is structured to help you easily find detailed information about each project:

- **[CostCenter Autotag](./CostCenter_Autotag/README.md)**: Navigate to the `CostCenter_Autotag` folder for details on the automated cost center tagging solution.
- **[Dynamic AWS Resource Tagging](./Dynamic_AWS_Resource_Tagging/README.md)**: Go to the `Dynamic_AWS_Resource_Tagging` folder for insights into automatic resource tagging at creation.
- **[Quilt CI/CD](./Quilt_CICD/README.md)**: Explore the `Quilt_CICD` folder for information on the CI/CD pipeline setup for Quilt releases.

Each folder contains a dedicated README file with in-depth information about the project's objectives, approach, challenges, and future scope. Feel free to explore and delve into the technical details.

### Project Highlights üåê

---

### üéØ **CostCenter Autotag**

![CostCenter Icon](https://img.icons8.com/emoji/48/000000/dollar-banknote.png)

**Objective:** Automatically tag AWS resources across multiple accounts with a custom cost center tag.

**Key Features:**
- Utilizes AWS Resource Explorer for indexing and searching resources without a cost center tag.
- Employs AWS Resource Groups Tagging API for tagging resources and DynamoDB for logging failed resource ARNs.
- Schedules tagging processes with AWS EventBridge to ensure ongoing compliance with cost center tagging policies.

**Challenges:**
- Limited to tagging up to 1000 resources at a time due to API constraints.

**Future Scope:** The solution can be expanded to cover more resource types and additional custom tags as needed.

---

### üîß **Dynamic AWS Resource Tagging**

![Dynamic Tagging Icon](https://img.icons8.com/emoji/48/000000/label.png)

**Objective:** Automatically tag AWS resources at the time of creation with the user‚Äôs email or name.

**Key Features:**
- Integrates AWS CloudTrail and Custom Event Bus to capture and forward resource creation events.
- Utilizes Lambda functions to extract user details from events and tags resources via AWS Resource Groups Tagging API.

**Challenges:**
- Requires manual updates to include and parse creation events for each desired AWS resource type.

**Future Scope:** The system can be expanded to automate tagging for a broader range of AWS resources and tags.

### üöÄ **Quilt CI/CD**

![CI/CD Icon](https://img.icons8.com/emoji/48/000000/rocket.png)

**Objective:** Automate the deployment of Quilt releases in AWS, minimizing manual intervention.

**Key Features:**
- Implements an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline.
- Leverages AWS CodeCommit, CodeBuild, SNS, and Lambda for orchestrating build and deployment processes.
- Adopts a principle of least privilege for dynamic permissions configuration.

**Challenges:**
- Ensuring secure and efficient pipeline configuration while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.

**Future Scope:** Further refinement of the pipeline to support more complex deployment scenarios and additional AWS services.
